Waltham Forest Migrant Action is run entirely by volunteers, and we welcome contact from like-minded individuals who would like to get involved. 

Volunteer vacancies are listed below. If you are interested in applying or would like more information, please get in touch by emailing us at [info@wfma.org.uk](info@wfma.org.uk), introducing yourself and outlining your interest in the role. 

#### Vacancy - Advocate
Volunteer advocates at the Friday morning Support Centre welcome visitors, make tea and chat to them - as well as take their details and sit in with them during their time with the advisors. They then also perform any follow-up actions, including signposting to services such as food banks and health organisations, and assisting with form-filling. 

Advocates attend the Centre approximately once a month on a rota system. Full training is given.
