Waltham Forest Migrant Action is run entirely by volunteers, and we welcome contact from like-minded individuals who would like to get involved. 

Volunteer vacancies are listed below. If you are interested in applying or would like more information, please get in touch by emailing us at [info@wfma.org.uk](info@wfma.org.uk), introducing yourself and outlining your interest in the role. 

#### Vacancy - Advocate
Volunteer advocates at the Friday morning Support Centre welcome visitors, make tea and chat to them - as well as take their details and sit in with them during their time with the advisors. They then also perform any follow-up actions, including signposting to services such as food banks and health organisations, and assisting with form-filling. 

Advocates attend the Centre approximately once a month on a rota system. Full training is given.

#### Vacancy - Events Volunteer
Waltham Forest Migrant action is looking for an Events Volunter. WFMA runs a variety of events in the borough to raise money to cover the running costs of the Support Centre. Past events have included gigs, a Burns night dinner, and pub quizzes at the Rose and Crown. If you'd like to help organise and coordinate events like this (or maybe you have a few ideas of your own?) then please get in touch at [events@wfma.org.uk](events@wfma.org.uk).
