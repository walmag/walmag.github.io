Walthamstow Migrants’ Action Group is run entirely by volunteers, and we welcome contact from like-minded individuals who would like to get involved. 

Volunteer vacancies are listed below. If you are interested in applying or would like more information, please get in touch by emailing us at e17migrantscentre@gmail.com, introducing yourself and outlining your interest in the role. 

Vacancy - Trustee
Our Board has vacancies for three Trustees. We are looking for energetic, focused
individuals who have skills to bring and whose values align with ours.

We are particularly keen to hear from those with personal experience of the migration
system and/or a background in:
• Fundraising and funding applications
• Campaigning
• Communications

Vacancy - Advocate
Volunteer advocates at the Friday morning Support Centre welcome visitors, make tea and chat to them - as well as take their details and sit in with them during their time with the advisors. They then also perform any follow-up actions, including signposting to services such as food banks and health organisations, and assisting with form-filling. 

Advocates attend the Centre approximately once a month on a rota system. Full training is given.

Vacancy - Fundraising Coordinator
We want to grow our organisation, and increasing our funds is central to this aim. We are looking for an energetic individual with experience in fundraising and/or making successful funding applications to join our Working Group, help us identify new revenue streams and reach our goals.
