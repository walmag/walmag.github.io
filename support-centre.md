Our weekly Support Centre offers our migrant visitors free advice on immigration, accommodation and welfare issues, as well as signposting to other organisations that can help. We also provide a warm welcome, tea and biscuits, and opportunities to socialise and practise speaking English.

Our visitorsâ€™ needs and welfare are our top priority. We always do our best to help while respecting anonymity and listening without judgement in the strictest of confidence.
