We are keen to gather stories for our public campaigns around migration issues, so if you are willing to share your story, please let us know at the Support Centre or by email at [info@wfma.org.uk](mailto:info@wfma.org.uk). We will always protect your anonymity.


#### Free English lessons for women
All women with limited or no English are welcome to join these free, informal sessions, which take place during opening hours at the Waltham Forest Migrantsâ€™ Support Centre. 

Lessons are offered every Friday, all year. Just drop in, or [get in touch](/contact-us) if you would like more information.

#### Waltham Forest ESOL
We work to ensure all migrants in Waltham Forest have access to quality English language training, through our connection with Waltham Forest ESOL.

#### Welcoming Syrian Families to Waltham Forest
We are part of the initiative to welcome these new members of our community, and to make their transition to life in our borough as smooth and happy as possible.
