Walthamstow Migrants’ Action Group was formed in 2013 with three aims:

1. To support migrants in Waltham Forest
2. To promote integration between migrants and non-migrants
3. To challenge negativity about migrants in political and media discourse

We work towards these aims through our Support Centre, our campaigning and community work, and events. 

As life becomes ever more difficult for migrants across London, the UK and the world, we want to step up our work and fight back in solidarity and support of fellow human beings who are often suffering in the most extreme of circumstances.


Walthamstow Migrants’ Action Group is governed by a Board of Trustees. You can read our constitution here.
Chair: Helen Taylor
Vice Chair: Douglas Saltmarshe
Secretary: Sophia Fergus
Treasurer: Rosie Carter-Rich
Trustees: Sarah Walker, Rod Holmes, Tommy Anderson, Amber Akram, Ulrike Schmidt, Norman Minter, Silvia Constantino

If you have any questions about who we are, what we do, how we work or how to get involved, you can contact us in confidence at any time.
